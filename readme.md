H-500 Computer Lab
==================

The H-500 was a digital logic trainer built by Digital Equipment Corporation in the late 1960's. It provided hands-on experience with basic digital logic, and included a 173 page companion workbook ([PDF at archive.org](https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_dechandboobWorkbook1969_6837997)) covering binary, basic logic gates, flip flops, Boolean algebra, binary counters, serial addition, parallel addition, Binary coded decimal, code conversion, and system considerations.

The main building blocks of the H-500 are:

* 8x Flip Flops (via 2x Flip Flop stamps) - In progress
* 8x 2-input NAND gates (via 3x 2-3-4 input NAND stamps) - In progress
* 6x 3-input NAND gates 
* 4x 4-input NAND gates
* 4x 4-input AND-NOR gates (via 2x AND-NOR stamps) - In progress
* 8x switches - Stamp complete
* 8x indicators - Stamp complete
* 3x pulsers - Not yet started
* 1x variable clock - Not yet started

This project re-creates the H-500 using the [Protonema](https://github.com/dslik/protonema) form factor to create an inexpensive and expandable learning environment that lets you start with the H-500 workbook, then add breadboards and additional stamps, even ones you design yourself.

This project is currently a work-in-progress, with the various stamps currently under development and testing.
